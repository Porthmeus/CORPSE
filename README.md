# CORPSE - CObRaPy tool SEt
CORPSE is an extension to the CobraPy environment to make some extra functionality - I initiated this because I missed functions for reconstruction of specific models.

The toolset incudes functions for:
+ mapping gene expression values to reactions
+ get essential genes/rxn depending on the global lower and upper and local thresholds
+ calculate distances on FVA results for different samples/simulations of the same model 

## Installation

Simply use pip to install the package:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Porthmeus/CORPSE.git

Alternatively clone/download the package and install it manually

    git clone https://github.com/Porthmeus/CORPSE.git
    cd CORPSE
    python setup.py install


## TODO:
Write a good documentation with examples how to use the library
